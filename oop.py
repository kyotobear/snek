"""What is an initializer?
As the name suggests, the initializer is used to initialize an object of a class. 
Its a special method that outlines the steps that are 
performed when an object of a class is created in the program. Itâ€™s used to define and assign values to instance variables. We will discuss the concept of instance variables in the next lesson. 
For now, just focus on the syntax.

The intialization method is similar to other
methods but has a pre-defined name:
__init__

"""In Python,
properties can be defined into two parts:
- Class variables
- Instance variables

class variables are shared by all instances or objects of the classes.
A change in the class variable will: 
change the value of the property in 
in all the objects of the class.

Instance variables: are unique to each instance
or object of the class.
A change in the instance variable will change the value of the property
in that specific object only.

Class variables are defined "OUTSIDE" of the initializer
while Instance variables are defined "INSIDE" the initializer.
