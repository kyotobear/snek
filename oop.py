"""What is an initializer?
As the name suggests, the initializer is used to initialize an object of a class. 
Its a special method that outlines the steps that are 
performed when an object of a class is created in the program. Itâ€™s used to define and assign values to instance variables. We will discuss the concept of instance variables in the next lesson. 
For now, just focus on the syntax.

The intialization method is similar to other
methods but has a pre-defined name:
__init__

a class is created."""
