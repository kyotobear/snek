As the name suggests, the initializer is used to initialize an object of a class. 
Its a special method that outlines the steps that are 
performed when an object of a class is created in the program. Itâ€™s used to define and assign values to instance variables. We will discuss the concept of instance variables in the next lesson. 
For now, just focus on the syntax.

The intialization method is similar to other
methods but has a pre-defined name:
__init__

class variables are shared by all instances or objects of the classes.

Instance variables: are unique to each instance

A change in the instance variable will change the value of the property

Class variables are defined "OUTSIDE" of the initializer
