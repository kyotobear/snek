# In this exercise, you must implement the rep_cat function. 
# You are given two integers, x and y, as arguments. You must convert them into strings.
#  The string value of x must be repeated 10 times and the string value of y must be repeated 5 times.

# At the end, y will be concatenated to x and the resulting string must returned.


# Sample Input#
# x = 3
# y = 4
# Sample Output#
# '333333333344444'

#     string_x = str(x)
#     string_y = str(y)

# In this challenge, you must implement the factorial() function.
#  It takes an integer as a parameter and calculates its factorial.
# #  Python does have a built-in factorial function but youâ€™ll be creating your own for practice.
# The factorial of a number, n, is its product with all the integers between 0 and n.

# factorial for 0 and 1 is always 1.
# sample input n = 5
# sample output 120

# factorial(n) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) *

# Exercise: Balanced Brackets
"""Given a string containing only square brackets,
